Learning Activities & Resources: 
This week I started getting deeper into full-site editing in WordPress through linkedin learning. Dived into the gutenberg plugin and explored it's usefulness and benefits in time constraints. This week I have also found and joined a group for our second assessment. Since we will be using Trello during the process I started learning more about Trello through its online forum and youtube. Additionally, We planned our first group meeting and went through with it.

Content Insights:
Before we had our first group meeting, I started by creating a discord server for our meetings and communication. Then I moved onto Trello, set up a trello board for our project. started playing around in the board to see how much I can utilise this platform. I invited my group members and everyone was able to join and edit the board without any issues. Although, during writing our group agreement I came to realize that Trello does not allow live editing by everyone, If someone changes something and saves it then it alters what others wrote during that time. So, we decided to write it individually one after another. We connected each other on linked in right after. Everyone seemed agreeable and mutual and keen to put good effort in this project, we set roles for everyone and decided we will be working with wordpress during this project.  

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
After the first meeting and getting the practical done, I realised Trello's effectiveness. This helped us easily distribute tasks and keep track of them as we go. Trello also has a reminder and you can use it to remind members before their upcoming meeting. Going forward, I already know I will be using Trello not only during group projects but for my own time constraint practice.
