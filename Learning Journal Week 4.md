Learning Activities & Resources: 
I began by researching various options for setting up a local development environment and deploying local sites to production. I decided to use XAMMP to setup a virtual machine to host my site locally. To gain a better understanding of setting up a local development environment and deploying sites, I watched several YouTube tutorials. In addition to YouTube tutorials, I enrolled in courses on LinkedIn
Learning. Those courses provided valuable insights into advanced topics such as site customization, SEO optimization, security, and troubleshooting.

Content Insights:
I applied the knowledge gained from tutorials and courses to experiment with different themes, plugins, and customization options. Successfully set up a local development environment using XAMPP, thanks to its 
simplicity and versatility. While setting up my local development environment, I encountered a challenge when I tried accessing mysql admin. It kept saying I was missing "mysqli" extension. I had to uninstall XAMMP completely and started from the beginning. After a bit of digging, I found that some of the features in my control panel was turned off. Also, I had to go to BIOS and enable virtualization manually. I also noticed that mysql workbench was not running properly so, I installed mysql workbench again. After doing all the following, I was able to setup my local host and access mysql admin. Once I was able to access phpmyadmin, I created a new database. Installed wordpress on my localhost and started working on my site. This experience taught me the importance of troubleshooting and problem-solving skills in website development.

 Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
 This prac allowed me to develop my skills in web development and deployment. Overcoming challenges and errors during the setup process boosted my confidence and resilience in tackling technical issues independently. Going forward, I plan to keep exploring more WordPress features to further enhance my skills and knowledge. I was able to effectively build up a dynamic site with a database on my localhost and obtain a deeper understanding of WordPress by watching video tutorials, online courses, and practical experience. I also realised the importance of version control and backups in the development process.
