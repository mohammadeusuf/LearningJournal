Content Insight:
Bootstrap template really helped me in building the structure and styling of the pages for this prac. The HTML tutorial videos helped me have the solid foundation again and I was able to change/tailor the page to my liking. Need to explore svg more as a lot more can be done with the svg elements.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
As the next pracs rquire me to work with Joomla and Wordpress, I have already started finding and bookmarking courses and tutorials on linked in learning to help me stay on track. After doing more reasearch, found out that wordpress is the most popular CMS out there because it seems more user friendly and better functionality. Need to watch some good tutorials to get familiar with Joomla.
