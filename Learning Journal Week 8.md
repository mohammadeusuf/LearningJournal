Learning Activities & Resources:
For this week's learning experiment, I decided to test the hypothesis that spaced repetition would improve my retention and understanding of complex concepts compared to cramming sessions. To implement this, I used Anki, a spaced repetition flashcard app, and created flashcards for the key concepts I wanted to learn.

Estimated Hours:
4 hours of learning.

Content Insights:
Throughout the week, I reviewed the flashcards on Anki at regular intervals. Each session consisted of reviewing both new and previously learned concepts. I noticed that spaced repetition allowed me to revisit concepts just before I was about to forget them, reinforcing my memory over time. This method also helped in breaking down harder topics into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier to understand and retain information.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
The results of the experiment were promising. I discovered that using regular repetitions greatly enhanced my ability to remember the material in comparison to rushing. By spacing out my learning sessions, I was able to retain information more effectively and for a longer period. This experiment highlighted the importance of implementing effective study techniques, such as spaced repetition, to optimize learning outcomes. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate spaced repetition into my regular study routine to enhance my learning experience further.
