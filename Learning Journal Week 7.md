Learning Activities & Resources:
This week, I started learning and practicing writing PHP code, making changes to websites, and researching AWS Lightsail and its usefulness. To enhance my PHP skills, I explored online tutorials, documentation, and practical exercises focusing on PHP syntax, 
functions, loops, and conditional statements which would be helpful for this week's prac. Learned how to setup local server using Command Prompt. I also delved deeper into WordPress development, experimenting with theme customization, plugin integration, and 
PHP code implementation to add dynamic features to websites. Additionally, I dedicated time to researching AWS Lightsail through various online resources, including official documentation, tutorials, and user reviews, to understand its features, benefits, and
potential use cases.

Content Insights:
Throughout the week, I gained a deeper understanding of PHP fundamentals, including variable declaration, data types, control structures, and functions. Practical exercises helped strengthen my understanding of PHP concepts, and I applied this knowledge to
modify website elements and add dynamic functionality. I created a very basic blank site and added php codes to change their dynamics and add features. I gained experience in structuring web projects by organizing reusable components such as headers and 
footers using PHP includes. Found that it was easy to do this in a local server using separate files for each functions. In WordPress development, I explored advanced theme customization techniques, such as integrating custom PHP code to extend website 
functionality. Additionally, my research on AWS Lightsail provided valuable insights into its features, such aseasy server setup, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, making it a great option for hosting and deploying our site.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
My ability to construct dynamic and interactive web applications has improved as a result of improving my PHP knowledge and using them in practical tasks. Developing websites with PHP has also strengthened my problem-solving abilities and equipped me to take
on real-world development challenges. My knowledge of cloud computing technologies has also grown as a result of my research of AWS Lightsail, and I have acquired the skills required to use flexible hosting solutions when creating websites. All things 
considered, the learning exercises for this week have improved my skills as a web developer and given me the tools I need to create reliable, scalable websites.
