Learning Activities & Resources: Watched videos on youtube on how to create a Joomla website on local host (XAMMP). I was struggling to setup XAMMP local server on my pc in the begining. Tried watching youtube solutions but I could not fix the "phpmyadmin error".
It kept saying mysqli missing even though I enabled that extension. So, I decided to to go to a hosting service online(Host Gator). After watching a few more tutorials on how to install joomla and how to navigate and make changes into the backend I learned that
the user interface og Joomla is quite confusing at times and I kept getting lost. After watchinga few more videos and spending eons I am getting the hang of it but need to explore/design more in the following week. Useful links:

Estimated hours: Learning 6.5 hours, working and practicing 4 hours

Content Insights: Installing and configuring XAMMP for local host is free but a complicated process. Hosting service is an easier but costly option. I have found host gator to be affordable and has easy wordpress configuration and joomla features. Need to
explore Cpanel a bit more and get familiar with the interface.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
While working on the prac I realized my PHP knowledge is very limited. In order to cahnge and add new features on my site it is important to expand my experience with PHP. One of my favourite part of this language is that I can easily add PHP code in an HTML
code to customize and change content style/structures. I have also found lots of templates for Joomla online. I could use them and modify them to my needs to make my site look better. For future help:
